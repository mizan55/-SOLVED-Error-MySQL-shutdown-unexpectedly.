Error solve! withoutloosing db


To solve this problem

Step 1. Rename the folder c:\xampp\mysql\data to c:\xampp\mysql\data_old (you can use any name).

Step 2. Create a new folder c:\xampp\mysql/data.

Step 3. Copy the content that resides in mysql\backup to the new mysql\data folder.

Step 4. Copy all your database folders that are in mysql\data_old to mysql\data (skipping the mysql, performance_schema, and phpmyadmin folders from data_old).

Step 5. Finally copy the ibdata1 file from mysql\data_old and replace it inside mysql\data folder.

Step 6. Start MySQL from XAMPP control panel.

And, Its DONE . No databases lost, no ports changed, no run as administrator, no force recovery, no kill mysqld process, no restoring from previous versions, no more errors.
